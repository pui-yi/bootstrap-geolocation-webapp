# bootstrap-geolocation-webapp
A toy store web app featured with techniques of Bootstrap and Geolocation. Here is the [URL](https://pui-yi.github.io/bootstrap-geolocation-webapp/) to my web app.
<br><br>

## Objective:
Use Bootstrap to create a web app for mobile devices and the application of Geolocation. 

<br><br>

## Tasks:
A group of buttons (navigation) is included in all the pages so the user can go to any of the pages (a navigation bar). When the page is scrolled down, the user will still see that navigation bar.

The name of the starting page is index.html - this file contains the main content of the first page. Besides the index.html page, I also create 4 extra pages: 
- A Contact Us page that shows the email address, telephone number, address, URL to the facebook page (a fake one, of course) of the company. I will also provide a small form to request the name, email address, and a comment area, with a submit button so the company can collect some information from the user. The form created that is mobile ready, using the new HTML 5 input elements and other tags to make your form accessible.
- A Products page that shows a list of at least 3 toys – picture and some description – this list should be collapsible so the user will open it by clicking on the name of the toy to see the picture and the description of the toy. 
- A Location page that shows the current latitude and longitude of the user written on that page. The page presents a map with the current location of the user - the location of the user will be automatically retrieved.
- An Extra page that includes description of 3 capabilities offered by WURFL database (it's not the characteristics of WURFL or what is WURFL), it's related to the capabilities that a developer, with access to WURFL, can use and test against the device that is requesting the application - for example, there is a capability called brand_name that will give the brand of the device.
